API used to support CRUD operations on cab locations. 

Tweaked the specs to add the additional flexibility

Create: latitude/longitude must be specified.  No id should be provided.  A 400 will be thrown if latitude or longitude is missing in the params

Read: the radius and limit parameters are optional.  If no radius is provided, then all relevant cabs will be returned.  If no limit is provided, then all relevant cabs will be returned.  Distance was calculated based on miles.

Update: when an id is provided, only one of latitude or longitude need be provided.  If a latitude or longitude is not provided, it will use the existing latitude/longitude and update only the specified latitude/longitude.  If both are specified, then both latitude and longitude will be updated

Destroy: 404 is returned if you try to delete an unfound cab
